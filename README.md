# aggreGATOR

In order to use the aggreGATOR cli, you will need to also install Postgres and Go
<i>Installing from boot.dev itself might make it easier</i>
You will also need to install the repo itself
```
git clone https://github.com/richardw55555/aggreGATOR.git
```
You will also need to make a file in the installed folder called .gatorconfig
[Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/lessons/d049abb2-c733-4986-a33a-73f05e2ea06c) Can help with this too

The commands you can run are
login:  logs in a registered user
register: registers a user
reset: resets the database
users: lists all users
agg: gets data from added feeds
feeds: lists all feeds
follow: follows a feed
unfollow: unfollows a feed
browse: browses data from agg
